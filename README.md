**Next-Gen DeFi for Real-World Impact**

BlaroThings bridges decentralized finance (DeFi) with real-world government Purchase Order (PO) financing—empowering SMEs while offering crypto investors access to low-risk, stablecoin-backed investment opportunities.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

BlaroThings is a DeFi platform built on Binance Smart Chain that enables users to fund government-issued purchase orders for SMEs. Investors contribute stablecoins (USDT/USDC), which are converted to fiat and disbursed to suppliers. Upon maturity, government payments are received into escrow and converted back to stablecoins for distribution to investors.

Our mission is to:
- Address the SME financing gap.
- Provide predictable and insured yields for crypto investors.
- Showcase how blockchain can support public finance and institutions.
